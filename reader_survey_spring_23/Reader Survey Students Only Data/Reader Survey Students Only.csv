And no thoughts from the reporter on the responsibility of the individual to be responsible for having an umbrella or a rain jacket.  Geez, we can be better!","Pretty good.

I would use the repeat options for the questions in this form as a reference for the Diamondback’s level of quality control.",You seem to cover everything that happens on campus? I think?,"All articles feel heavily biased… there are some things I read on your site that aren’t labeled as “Opinion” articles but are incredibly skewed in the way that they are written. Your job is to be objective and just share the facts, not write a narrative that is biased and skewed in a way that is in alignment with your moral and/or political opinion(s).

I am curious how often you check the form that readers can fill out about potential stories. If you’re not checking it (or are rarely checking it), you are doing yourself a great disservice.

More transparency on the wages you give your workers would be good."

Word of Mouth",Better Twitter updates from accounts and reporters. More focus on Maryland state politics and local DC area coverage.,"The Diamondback is probably one of the few reliable news sources for local news I can rely on. Whenever I look for news about what’s happening in College Park or in Prince George’s County, I first check to see if the Diamondback has covered it.",More DC area news stories if possible. Perhaps highlight more development of the city and university community. Definitely more political and government coverage and how it’s impacting the UMD community. Perhaps even consider partnering with Greater Greater Washington on a few things regarding PG County news stories on transportation and development stories.

Word of Mouth","Ok this is small but it's always bothered me that on the website on desktop, news article text is literally at the edge of the screen, like there's no space/margin between the screen and the text. Is there a way to add space there for readability? and... I miss the physical copies of the newspaper :( but that's ok. I also wish there was a little place for short reader responses, I know that you can have guest columnists and articles responding to other articles but sometimes I have a little response (like a paragraph) that I wish I could just shoot off really quick, and then all these responses could be compiled into a larger post or something..?","Love the weekly newsletters! They're the main way I get news and I read them every day. Not sure how many people read them but I personally would love to see more stuff in them - could be anything, more articles, more summary text, a little crossword like Vox does, idk! And also my favorite section of the DBK is diversions! OH BY THE WAY, the playlist recommendation article website thing was SO cool AND as someone who's started going into DC a lot I really liked the DC review guide!",

Dough and Trader Joe’s. There will also be the new DogHaus opening soon as well.","I think diamondback excels when it talks about local topics that I can’t get from other news sources. Although I don’t read the articles of news sports, I do like skimming headlines to know if we’re in an upswing. Perhaps some sort of weekly or monthly summary of sports could be good? (Though that could be overlapping with Terrapin Sports Central)

Frankly, I enjoy reading most about construction updates from the Diamondback. I like to know when new restaurants are being built, or if there will be new housing or apartments coming to the area. If there are changes to the roadways I need to watch out for.","Your poll could be updated. From what I can tell, Unwind magazine doesn’t exist anymore and The Left Bench changed its name to Terrapin Sports Central (although their weekly show is still called the left bench?)"
