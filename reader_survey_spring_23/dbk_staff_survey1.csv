Word of Mouth",I think reporting on the local impact of more national and international events would be cool. I was kinda disappointed to see that there wasn't any coverage of the World Cup and I feel like covering the community impact of national and international events would be really cool to see more of. ,,

I also think an advice column would be sick. Also, more data stories/resources!! Also maybe more music/movie/book reviews?",Breaking news stories and developing stories. Love the data content so far. Also some of the these div articles are so fun!,Maybe there could be a way for DBK to connect with the campus community more and get more input from them to help us report more FOR them. Like asking the community what they want to know more about this semester? Ask them what questions they have about developments like new traffic patterns or masking in classes. These are just examples but you catch my drift
