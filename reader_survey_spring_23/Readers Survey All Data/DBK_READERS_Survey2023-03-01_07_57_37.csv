I would use the repeat options for the questions in this form as a reference for the Diamondback’s level of quality control.","You seem to cover everything that happens on campus? I think?","All articles feel heavily biased… there are some things I read on your site that aren’t labeled as “Opinion” articles but are incredibly skewed in the way that they are written. Your job is to be objective and just share the facts, not write a narrative that is biased and skewed in a way that is in alignment with your moral and/or political opinion(s).

I am curious how often you check the form that readers can fill out about potential stories. If you’re not checking it (or are rarely checking it), you are doing yourself a great disservice.

More transparency on the wages you give your workers would be good."

Dough and Trader Joe’s. There will also be the new DogHaus opening soon as well.","I think diamondback excels when it talks about local topics that I can’t get from other news sources. Although I don’t read the articles of news sports, I do like skimming headlines to know if we’re in an upswing. Perhaps some sort of weekly or monthly summary of sports could be good? (Though that could be overlapping with Terrapin Sports Central)

Frankly, I enjoy reading most about construction updates from the Diamondback. I like to know when new restaurants are being built, or if there will be new housing or apartments coming to the area. If there are changes to the roadways I need to watch out for.","Your poll could be updated. From what I can tell, Unwind magazine doesn’t exist anymore and The Left Bench changed its name to Terrapin Sports Central (although their weekly show is still called the left bench?)"

And no thoughts from the reporter on the responsibility of the individual to be responsible for having an umbrella or a rain jacket.  Geez, we can be better!","Pretty good.

Word of Mouth","Ok this is small but it's always bothered me that on the website on desktop, news article text is literally at the edge of the screen, like there's no space/margin between the screen and the text. Is there a way to add space there for readability? and... I miss the physical copies of the newspaper :( but that's ok. I also wish there was a little place for short reader responses, I know that you can have guest columnists and articles responding to other articles but sometimes I have a little response (like a paragraph) that I wish I could just shoot off really quick, and then all these responses could be compiled into a larger post or something..?","Love the weekly newsletters! They're the main way I get news and I read them every day. Not sure how many people read them but I personally would love to see more stuff in them - could be anything, more articles, more summary text, a little crossword like Vox does, idk! And also my favorite section of the DBK is diversions! OH BY THE WAY, the playlist recommendation article website thing was SO cool AND as someone who's started going into DC a lot I really liked the DC review guide!",

The student journalists should be using this as an opportunity to practice who, what, where, when,and why. Not to forget triple checking your source vs. the current lazy news practice of copying and pasting. ","Reading the City Council meeting reporting can be entertaining, rarely are all the facts gathered, with followup articles on the issues. ","Have the reporters learn the actual boundaries of Hyattsville.  The local TV news stations certainly don't know it.  This brings up the question,  if the local news stations don't get the facts right on local stories, how do we know they are getting the facts right whe reporting national and political news?"

It’s refreshing to not be fed the propaganda from administration lol. ","Secondly, I think a piece about Maryland athletics overselling the student section at basketball games could be quite interesting. Two games this season they have sold more tickets than allotted and forced students into the 200s. As well, an opinion piece on the distribution of shirts at basketball games. It gets frustrating when you wait in line but people arrive, take shirts, and leave, leaving you to find a seat with no shirt when you intend to stay for the whole game. Maryland athletics has a great student culture. The Wall is so energetic, but the small things like I mentioned are really disheartening for those of us that love Terp sports.  "

Maryland Today","Local news coverage has been VERY POOR over the last year.  Several years ago (before COVID) The Diamondback used have great coverage of new developments and business openings & closings throughout College Park and other Rt. 1 communities.  Now you barely put any effort at all into these stories.  This week there was a belated business ""roundup"" article, with one paragraph devoted to each business opening & closing.  Why weren't these events being covered as they happened ?  Not too long ago, The Diamondback would've had one article each for every one of those paragraphs.  Very disappointed the way the local coverage has been going the last few years.","The coverage of social issues is well meaning and admirable, though it gets excessive at times.  Too many other news stories get missed as a result.","Focus more on solid local news coverage stories and less on shallow ""click bait"" articles.  The Diamondback used to be a higher quality source of news."

Since the demise of the print edition, which via real ads, it has lost real revenue to pay for its existence. Returning to a online print version similar to what was available, and many college papers still provide, or a format like WaPo's online print version via app, would be a huge improvement. In addition, allow moderated comments for stories again relating to real issues in the community and outside world. These are just the beginning for things that could  be improved.

Online photo galleries might give people who live out of state or no longer live nearby, a glimpse of the campus.  For instance, I'm so old that I lived in Cumberland Hall when we had to walk past the goat barns to get to class. There are parts of the campus that I don't recognize anymore.","Issues on campus and surrounding communities, sports reporting.
