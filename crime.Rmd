## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)

```
```{r}
# read in crime data 2017-2022
crime <- read_csv("UMPD_crime_export_9_2017_to_9_2022.csv")

```

```{r}
# common places

place_crime <- crime %>%
  group_by(location_desc) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
  
```

```{r}
# common crime

type_crime <- crime %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```


```{r}
# common results

result_crime <- crime %>%
  group_by(disposition) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))


```
